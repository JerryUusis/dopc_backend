# Delivery Order Price Calculator service (DOPC)

DOPC is an imaginary backend service which is capable of calculating the total price and price breakdown of a delivery order. 
DOPC integrates with the Home Assignment API to fetch venue related data required to calculate the prices.
This project as my implementation for [Wolt's backend internship preliminary](https://github.com/woltapp/backend-internship-2025).
